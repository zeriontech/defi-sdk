**DeFi SDK** is an open-source system of smart contracts allows you to do arbitrary trades of ERC20 tokens.

If you have any questions about DeFi SDK, feel free to reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://go.zerion.io/discord).

## Features

* Trades any ERC20 token
* Two types of amounts -- absolute (usual amount) and relative (percentage of balance)
* Three types of `permit()` function for providing approvals in one transactions (EIP2612, DAI-like, Yearn-like)
* Two types of swaps -- with fixed input amount or fixed output amount
* Two types of fees:
  * protocol fee managed by the Router contract owner with possibility of one-time discounts requiring signature of an address with the special role
  * marketplace fee managed by the transaction creator
* Relayed transactions requiring just an EIP712 signature of the user
* Requirements for input and output tokens (allowing slippage on both sides)

## Security Vulnerabilities 🛡

If you discover a security vulnerability within DeFi SDK, please send us an e-mail at inbox@zerion.io.
All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Dev Notes

This project uses Hardhat, which runs tests extremely fast!
The project (Router contract and its dependencies) is fully covered with tests.
Fees are applied so that return amount = actual output amount / (1 + fee percentage)

#### Set environment

Rename `.env.sample` file to `.env`, and fill in the env variables.

`INFURA_API_KEY` is required for Router contract tests as it uses mainnet forking feature.

#### Compile contracts

`npm run compile`

#### Run tests

`npm run test`

#### Run Solidity code coverage

`npm run coverage`

#### Run Solidity and JS linters

`npm run lint`
